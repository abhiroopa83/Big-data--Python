## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Python is a general purpose and high level programming language bec it is not written in machine readable form. Python program
need to be processed before machine can run them. Python is an interpreted language. When program is run, its interpreter runs 
through the code and convert it into machine readable byte code.	

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Python is called a dynamically typed language bec type checking take place at run/execution time.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Proc: Python is easy to learn
      Python enhance productivity
      Python has a vast collection of libraries
      Python is free and open source
      Python is an interpreted language

Cons: Python has speed limitation
      Python is not so strong with mobile computation 
      Python can have run time error
      Python consumes a lot of memory space

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

    Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deeplearning, data engineering 

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
    Varibale is the name allocated to memory that is a refernece or pointer to an object. Once an objectis assigned to a variable, we can
refer to that object by that name. 
Declare: X=50  x is name of the object 50.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
    We can take input from user via input() function.
    Example: name = input("Enter your name: ")

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
   
    String
    

Q8. What is type casting?

    to change data type of varibale we use casting such as int(), float()

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

    no, we can take single input from user using single input function.

Q10. What are keywords?

     Keywords are special words in python what have specific meaning and purpose which can not be used for anythingbut those specific
purposes.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

     As keywords are special words which have specific meaning and used to define the syntax of the code. These keywords can not use
as varibale name.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

     Indentation is a block of space at the beginning of code line. we have to use same number of space in same blockof code otherwise
python will give error.


Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

     Print() function

Q14. What are operators in Python?

     Operator are used to perform operation on varibale and values. 

     Arthimetic operator
     Assignment operator
     Comparision operator
     Logical operator
     

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

     / is division operator eg: 5/2=2.5
     // is floor division operator eg: 5//2= 2

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
x="iNeuron"*4
Print(x)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
     
# Take input from user and check whether it is odd or even
number=int(input("Enter number"))
if (number%2)==0:
    print("Number is even")
else:
    print("Number is odd")  

Q18. What are boolean operator?

     Boolean operator is an expression that evaluate to either true or false.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0  = 1

0 and 0 = 0

True and False and True = False

1 or 0 or 0 = 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

  Condition statement is used to handle condition in program. Python have three conditional statement:
  If
  If-else
  If-elif-else
  

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

If: The if statement is a conditional statement that is used to determine whether a block of code will be executed or not.

If-else: the if statement executes the code block when the condition is true. Similarly, the else statement works in conjuncture 
with the if statement to execute a code block when the defined if condition is false.

if-elif-else: The elif statement is used to check for multiple conditions and execute the code block within if any of the conditions 
evaluate to be true.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

# Take input from user as age and put some condition for vote

Age=int(input("Enter your age"))
if Age>=18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can not vote")   

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
